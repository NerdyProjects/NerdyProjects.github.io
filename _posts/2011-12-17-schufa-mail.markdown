title: Schufa mailservers take a time off on weekends
date: 2011-12-17
excerpt: My experience with a mail sent to Schufa support
---

Because of a negative Schufa response (Schufa is a german organization that tracks most of your credit records so anyone can go ask them if person X may be a responsible credit partner), I asked them for my personal data record. I responded to their request for my additional and old postal addresses via mail to verbraucherantwort@schufa.de.

What then happened, amused me so much I decided to write this post:

I'm happy for those servers. Even the gate keeper worked as you would expect from a german official: The answer was delivered about 6 hours after my mail.
